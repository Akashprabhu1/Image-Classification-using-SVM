"Image Classification Using SVM" is a Python-based ML model that employs Support Vector Machines (SVM) for accurate image classification. Integrated with OpenCV, the project utilizes the device's camera for real-time training and prediction. Users can train the model with two objects, capturing their images or live video feeds. OpenCV facilitates image processing and feature extraction. Once trained, the model predicts object classes in real time. This flexible and efficient solution is applicable in various domains, providing rapid and accurate object recognition.![SS1](https://github.com/Akashprabhu1/Image-Classification-using-SVM/assets/95483193/7b471049-68f4-4d50-8d09-32aa159e6625)
